# Python Requirements for Sphinx AI Search Plugin - NumPy 2.x only

# Core dependencies - NumPy 2.x strict
numpy>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

# Machine Learning and AI - sentence-transformers automatically installs:
# torch, transformers, huggingface-hub, scikit-learn, scipy
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# OpenVINO for inference optimization - openvino-genai automatically installs openvino
openvino-genai>=2025.2.0

# Model conversion dependencies (required during setup only)
# These are needed by optimum-cli for model conversion with quantization
optimum[openvino]>=1.14.0
nncf>=2.9.0

# Natural Language Processing
nltk>=3.7
spacy>=3.4.0

# Database connectivity - Sphinx Search uses MySQL protocol
pymysql>=1.0.2

# Web and API
requests>=2.28.0

# Utilities
python-dateutil>=2.8.2
pyyaml>=6.0
python-dotenv>=0.20.0

# Development and testing (optional)
pytest>=7.1.0
pytest-cov>=3.0.0
black>=22.0.0
flake8>=5.0.0

# Notes on dependencies:
# - openvino: Automatically installed by openvino-genai with compatible version
# - torch, transformers, huggingface-hub, scikit-learn, scipy: Automatically installed by sentence-transformers
# - optimum[openvino]: Required for model conversion with optimum-cli during setup
# - nncf: Required for model quantization (int4/int8) during conversion
# - onnx, onnxruntime: Not used in codebase, OpenVINO handles inference
# - flask: Not used, plugin integrates with SMF
# - mysql-connector-python: Not used, only pymysql for Sphinx MySQL protocol

# Note: optimum[openvino] and nncf are primarily needed during model conversion.
# After setup is complete, they could theoretically be uninstalled, but keeping
# them ensures users can re-convert models if needed.

# Optional: GPU support for PyTorch (uncomment if needed)
# torch>=1.12.0+cu116
# torchvision>=0.13.0+cu116
# torchaudio>=0.12.0+cu116

# Optional: Additional NLP models (uncomment if needed)
# spacy-transformers>=1.1.0
# en_core_web_sm @ https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.4.0/en_core_web_sm-3.4.0.tar.gz
